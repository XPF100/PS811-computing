- if you can split screen somehow, great
- otherwise, better to watch my screen than to fudge on yours, since I will be giving away script

- tidying
    - data come in many forms
    - what is "tidy" data
        - each row is a case
        - each column is a variable
    - tidyr: package to take reshape data (make it tidy)
- functions

#   PS 811: Lesson 6
#   Data shaping (a.k.a. reshaping, a.k.a. tidying)
#   and functions
# ----------------------------------------------------

# ---- packages -----------------------

library("here")
library("tidyverse")
library("broom")



# ---- new dataset -----------------------

# votes in the 2000 term
scotus_raw <- 
  here("data", "Supreme-Court-2000.dta") %>%
  haven::read_dta() %>%
  print()



# 43 cases
# 1 = "liberal" vote. 2 = "conservative" vote.

# why do we encounter data like this?
# imagine a model to predict how justice i votes on case j
# y_{ij} = f( x_{i}, z_{j} )


# one way to represent a model like this mathematically 
# is to imagine that Y is a matrix (or 2D array) 
# with rows/columns that correspond to i/j


# ---- tidy data -----------------------

# what is it
# why is it useful
# https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf





# ---- "wide" and "long" data -----------------------


# "long" vs. "wide" data

# Pretend example w/ fake data
# (Don't worry about the code...only the output)

# a two-period, repeated-exposure experiment
n <- 10

# Wide data: repeated concepts across columns
wide <- tibble(
  id = 1:n,
  treatment_1 = sample(c(0, 1), n, replace = TRUE),
  treatment_2 = sample(c(0, 1), n, replace = TRUE),
  outcome_1 = sample(c(0, 1), n, replace = TRUE),
  outcome_2 = sample(c(0, 1), n, replace = TRUE)
) %>%
  print()


# Long data: repeated concepts across rows
long <- wide %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(-id),
    names_to = c(".value", "time"),
    names_sep = "_"
  ) %>%
  print()



# https://github.com/mkearney/tidy-animated-verbs/blob/master/images/tidyr-spread-gather.gif

# ---- comments!!!! -----------------------

# long data tends to fit with the "tidy" idea better
# but not always a universal rule, depending on the model.
# sometimes you want to make a graphic where it makes sense
#   to reshape just for the graphic.
# you should always be thinking about your needs





# ---- tidying operations -----------------------

# making data longer :: gathering :: melting
# making data wider  :: spreading :: casting

scotus_tidy <- scotus_raw %>%
  mutate(case = row_number()) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -case,
    names_to = "justice",
    values_to = "vote"
  ) %>%
  print()




scotus_wide <- scotus_tidy %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = case,
    values_from = vote,
    names_prefix = "case_"
  ) %>%
  print()




# ---- advanced case: multiple columns -----------------------

primaries <- 
  here("data", "house-primaries-top-two.csv") %>%
  read_csv() %>%
  print()


# if we wanted to calculate:
# ideological "distance" between candidates
# who won the primary

primaries %>%
  select(-cand_id) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    values_from = c(ideology_score, primary_vote),
    names_from = contestant_id
  )



# ----------------------------------------------------
#   Functions
# ----------------------------------------------------


# ---- anatomy of a function -----------------------

# name, arguments, value
# default arguments

?mutate

# what's the deal with "methods"
# some function names are "generic," 
#   meaning the same function name works for diff. object classes
#   even though the results are kinda different
# e.g. summary, print, old R functions like mean



# ---- writing functions -----------------------

# functions are objects

# create a function like it's an object
mean2 <- function()

# it's common to be function(x)
# but you can name arguments other things

# what will the function do? in curly braces
mean2 <- function(variable) {
  sum(variable) / length(variable)
} 


mean2(c(1, 2, 3))




# data frame considerations?




# ---- rundown of cool functions -----------------------

# coercing object types
as.logical(1)
as.factor(1)
as.character(1)

g <- 1

str_glue("combining text with objects like {g}")
as.character(str_glue("combining text with objects like {g}"))



# ---- different function types -----------------------

# prefix functions: mean(x)
# infix functions: 1 + 2
# replacement functions: attributes(data) <- [stuff]
# "special" functions: if (...), for (...)
# "functionals": functions that call other functions


# demonstration of "control flow"
if (2 + 2 == 4) {
  print("math makes sense")
} else {
  print("what's going on")
}


# demonstration of "for loop"
v <- vector()

for (i in 1:10) {
 v[i] <- i* 2
}

v

# but we hate for loops



# ---- functionals -----------------------

# supplying name only 
# (scale functions)

apply(scotus_raw, MARGIN = 1, FUN = mean)
apply(scotus_raw, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean)

# data frames are technically "lists"
as.list(scotus_raw)

lapply(scotus_raw, mean, na.rm = TRUE)

# also sapply to "simplify"
# vapply to return "vectors"
# tapply for "ragged arrays" (works like group_by %>% summarize)
# replicate: repeatedly apply 
# mapply: multivariate apply

  group_by(justice) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_liberal = mean(vote, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = justice, y = mean_liberal) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1),
    labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1),
    limits = c(0, 1)
  ) +
  coord_flip()

# why c(0, 1) and not c(0, 100)?
