## Version Control with Git

April 3, 2020

---

# Before we begin...

Canvas Announcement:


- **Install Git**
 
    - Mac: `xcode-select --install` in Terminal
    
    - Windows: download Git Bash app

- **Install Sourcetree**

    - A _graphical user interface_ (GUI) to GIt



---

# What is Git?

A technology that records the development of your project's **source code**

Changes to each file are **tracked**

**History of changes** like a trail of breadcrumbs

Retrace your steps, rewind progress, create "experimental" development paths, incorporate/manage collaborator contributions


---

# Why is Git?

Everything in one place: **portable** and **reproducible**

Trace the history of a project

- Radical transparency. You can share the whole development arc of the project.
- Helps you fix broken things, learn why results may have changed, etc.
- Natural complement to "preregistration" of study designs

Collaboration

- Who did what? Track changes for code!
- Enables division of labor, parallel development


---

# Why Git _for this class_?

Benefits of Git are routine in other technologies (MS Word track changes, etc...). No exaggeration to say that these are essential functions of modern intellectual labor.

--

Mysteriously (or, infuriatingly), the people who control your lives in grad school don't teach you how to implement them for code-based work, which is _a ton of what we do_.

--

In the industry world: an extremely valuable real-world skill for "deploying" code-based products (websites, apps, statistical/ML models, database management...). Employers require it.

# Project Workflow


---

class: middle

# So, I have a new project


1. Create a directory ("folder") for the project

2. Make it an Rstudio Project

3. Initialize Git repository

4. Periodically **commit** file changes (Saving files ≠ commiting)

[more...](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html#is-it-going-to-hurt)

# Step 1: Initialize Repository

In Sourcetree: `New` > `Create Local Repository`

# Step 2: Assess your working directory


---

# Step 2: Assess your working directory


The "File Status" screen in Sourcetree shows you the current state of your files.

- When you first begin a project, every file is **untracked**. Files will not be tracked until you first add/commit them. 
- Previously-committed files will show if they have been **modified** since previous commit
- Ignored files won't show up at all (more later)



---

# Step 3: Add and Commit Files


---

# Step 3: Add and Commit Files

A **"commit"** is a multi-file snapshot of your progress on a project.

- Choose which files to commit and "stage" them (check box beside file)
- Once files are staged, write "commit message" and **commit**
- **Give it a try**


--

Commit tips:

- Don't commit private stuff (passwords, confidential info...)
- Commits should be internally coherent, task-oriented.
- Don't group multiple tasks into one commit. 
- You can stage _lines_ in a file without staging the whole file.
- Write _informative_, verb-based commit messages (e.g. "simplify lit review").

The "History" view in Sourcetree shows your "git tree" (a.k.a. "graph")

Commits only save **changes** to files. Commits ID'd by "hash"

# What (not) to commit

The programmer's philosophy: commit the source code, not the output.

--

Data science is a little different:

- Obviously we commit the source code (otherwise, no output)
- Rmd makes _intermediate_ files that aren't important.
- Rmd final output? I commit.
- Statistical output? Sometimes helpful to diagnose why something changed/doesn't work anymore
- One possibility: use `sink()` to save R output & commit log file

--

Separate issue: big files



---

# Ignoring files

"I will never want to commit this file"

Ignoring files alters your `.gitignore` file, which you should commit/track.

You can ignore entire subfolders.

You can ignore certain file **patterns** (e.g. any `*.bbl` file, any folder that ends with `*_cache`)


---

#  Review/taking stock

.pull-left[
Project folder :: git repository

- source code
- data (we'll come back to this)
- notes/documentation
- graphics
- output
- intermediary files

]

.pull-right[
Git commands

- `git init`: create git repository
- `git status`: what's the state of my working directory?
- `git add ...`: stage files for commit
- `git commit ...`: commit file changes
- No `git ignore` command. Just add info to `.gitignore`

]


---

# Other quick tips

.pull-left[
Put `README.md` file(s) in your repository! 

- basic description of project and folder contents
- also helpful to explain contents of sub-folders (e.g. explaining how your script files relate to one another...)
]

.pull-right[
Computing environment:

- Save and commit the output from `devtools::session_info()`: info about your OS, R version, package versions...
- Use [`{renv}`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to manage package versions at the project level

# Step 4: Push to remote


---

# Step 4: Push to remote

Create a "remote repository" to share/back up your project

- On Github: New repository
    - Name repository (e.g. `polisci-811`), description optional
    - Set to public (upgrade to Github "student premium" for free private repo)
    - "Create Repository"
    - Copy repo URL: `https://github.com/username/repo-name.git`  

- In Sourcetree: Repository > Add Remote...
    - Remote name: `origin`
    - Paste URL, click OK

---

# Step 4: Push to remote

If we have done at least one commit, we can "push" the git repo to remote

In Sourcetree:

- On the Toolbar: click "Push" 
- Select "master". Pushing our local "master" branch to remote
- May need to authenticate Github username credentials

Copy of your repository is now on Github



---

# Why Remote?

If your computer dies in a fire, your project is safe

If you break your local repository, you can pull an unbroken copy

If you're collaborating with people, combine changes online

Share replication archive _as an entire project_


---

# Getting Help

Check out the [example project](https://github.com/mikedecr/example-project) from earlier in the semester or my [other repositories](https://github.com/mikedecr?tab=repositories)

Check the syllabus for resources.

Google before you try something new! Git is weird and you WILL mess things up. 

Again, you WILL mess things up. That's OK. Sometimes you need to throw away the `/.git/` folder and start it again...
